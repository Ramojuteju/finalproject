## Implementation Plan for Data Movement and Transformation Using Azure Data Factory Pipeline
### 1. Create an Azure Data Factory (ADF) Instance
* In the Azure portal, create an Azure Data Factory instance (retailfact23).
This will be the environment where your pipelines, datasets, and linked services are defined.
<img width="1740" alt="Data Factory" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce3c2385-24a9-46d2-8bd4-81f4c8ecb53a">

### 2. Define Linked Services
* Linked Service for Source: Create a linked service for your source data (Azure SQL Database, API).
<img width="1728" alt="ls_http" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a214f6a-d7e4-4c5d-bafa-99b42c75d3dc">
<img width="1726" alt="ls_sqldb" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/869802f8-c500-4a67-bdb1-880ba1ba71f3">
<img width="1746" alt="ls_gen2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f967e944-1c05-4699-848b-d44692f70e11">
<img width="1735" alt="ls_keyvault" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/88be4512-7edd-43ff-ad19-2e9a7ace9e46">
<img width="1725" alt="ls_dbricks" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc502e02-53aa-457a-96a2-e8534e44c196">

* This defines the connection to your data source.
* Linked Service for Sink (Data Lake Storage): Create a linked service to Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 where your raw data will be stored (mywarehouse23).
* This will define how ADF connects to your Data Lake storage.
  
### 3. Define the Pipeline with Copy Activity
* Create a Pipeline: Create a new pipeline in Azure Data Factory.
* Add a Copy Activity to the pipeline that moves and transforms data from the source to the raw container.
* Configure the Copy Activity:
<img width="1725" alt="DF - Pipelinehttp" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25437472-cc85-41a8-a6b6-d468245593e2">
<img width="1737" alt="Df - Pipelinesql" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ca00aa4-fc4f-4317-8c8f-399ee710dc6a">

* Source: Define the source dataset and transformation logic
* Sink: Define the sink dataset (the Raw Container in the Data Lake).

### Linked Service http:
<img width="637" alt="ht" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53beda14-5183-4848-a27c-ff669c95308c">

<img width="747" alt="key" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f98cd01-baf1-462e-b0e3-a2ecf5f3f183">

### 4. Add Data Flow 
* If transformations are needed (cleaning or data aggregation) add a Data Flow activity before the Copy Activity in the pipeline.
* Use Data Flow to filter out invalid records or to transform the data format before moving it to the Raw container.
### Trigger the Pipeline
* Trigger: Set up triggers (manual or scheduled) to run the pipeline at a specific time or when an event occurs.
* Set a scheduled trigger to run the pipeline every night to move the daily data.
<img width="1753" alt="Trigger" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9fdf73a4-c56f-4daf-8f8b-d9dedc7a4bf9">

### 5. Monitor the Pipeline Execution
* Monitor the pipeline execution and log any errors or issues using the Monitoring feature in Azure Data Factory.
* Review activity run details for success or failure.

### 6. Validate Data in Raw Container
* Once the pipeline successfully runs, validate that the data has been copied correctly to the Raw container in Azure Data Lake.
* You can check the data using Azure Storage Explorer or through the Azure portal.
<img width="1723" alt="raw" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cdfc39a9-461b-4a10-a689-d4e4b2d41223">

## Troubleshooting Points
### 1. Data Ingestion
### Connectivity Issues
* Data ingestion fails or times out: Check for Network Connectivity, Ensure that ADF (Azure Data Factory) and other services have proper network access (check firewall, VPN, private endpoints).
* Authentication Failures: Validate service principal permissions, connection strings, and API tokens.
* Integration Runtime Issues: If using self-hosted IR (Integration Runtime), check if the IR is running and connected.
### Source Data Connectivity
* Errors while pulling data from sources like SQL Database or API.
* API Rate Limiting: Ensure the API calls are within limits (monitor API logs).
* SQL Server Errors: Ensure SQL Server allows remote connections and the credentials are correct.
* Timeouts: Check if the timeout settings are too short in ADF or SQL Server.
### Schema Mismatches
* Data transformation fails due to changes in source schema, Implement dynamic schema handling in ADF, and use schema versioning in Delta Lake for tracking changes.
* Data Type Mismatches: Ensure the data types in source and destination match (varchar vs int).
* Missing Columns: Validate that all expected columns are present in source data.
### API Data Ingestion Failures
* API data fails to load or returns empty - API Authentication
* Recheck authentication keys, tokens and OAuth credentials.
* Check API Documentation: Verify that the API endpoints have not changed and are still functional.
* Error Handling: Set up retry policies to handle transient failures or throttling.
### 2. Data Transformation
### ETL Pipeline Failures: The data transformation fails, or the ETL job does not complete.
* Review Logs: Look at ADF or Databricks job logs for failure details.
* Ensure Sufficient Resources: Databricks clusters may require more nodes or a different configuration to handle large transformations.
* Timeout Settings: Check if the transformation job is timing out due to large data volumes.
* Retry Logic: Enable retry logic in ADF for transient errors.
### Data Quality Issues
* Incorrect data, such as nulls, duplicates invalid entries.
* Null Handling: Set up checks in the ETL pipeline to flag or impute null values.
* Data Duplication: Ensure deduplication logic is implemented in the transformation layer.
* Data Validation: Implement validation rules to check for data inconsistencies, such as valid ranges, value formats, or missing mandatory columns.
### Performance Bottlenecks
* Slow-running jobs or high resource consumption.
* Cluster Sizing: Check if the Databricks cluster size is sufficient for the transformation workload.
* Optimize Queries: Optimize SQL queries or Spark transformations, especially for large datasets.
* Partitioning Strategy: Ensure proper partitioning in Delta Lake tables to reduce query times.
* Caching: Cache frequently used datasets to improve performance.
### Join Failures
* Transformation job fails during a join operation.
* Verify Join Keys: Ensure the join keys exist in both datasets and are of the same data type.
* Broadcast Join: For small lookup tables, ensure you're using broadcast joins for better performance.
* Check for Nulls: Ensure join keys don't contain null values, as these could cause join failures.
### Aggregation Errors
* Incorrect aggregation results, like wrong totals or averages.
* Check Aggregation Logic: Validate the aggregation functions being used in the transformation (e.g., SUM, AVG).
* Granularity Mismatches: Ensure the aggregation is happening at the correct granularity level.
* Group-By Errors: Verify the correct fields are being grouped by.
### 3.Data Storage
### Data Loss or Missing Data
* Missing or incomplete files in Raw, Curated, or Staging containers.
* Enable Data Lake Versioning: Use Azure Data Lake Gen2 versioning to avoid accidental data loss.
* Validate Pipeline Execution: Ensure that the pipeline was successfully executed and there were no errors during the storage write process.
* Monitor File Uploads: Set up alerts in Azure Monitor to track file writes to the Raw, Curated, and Staging containers.
* Data Duplication: Duplicate records appear in the Raw or Curated container.
* Check Transformation Logic: Ensure the transformation jobs are handling duplication (e.g., using distinct() or dropDuplicates()).
* Check Data Loading: Ensure no data is being loaded more than once due to a misconfigured pipeline or incorrect timestamps.
### Storage Configuration Issues
* Inability to write or read data due to storage misconfiguration.
* File Format Compatibility: Ensure that the file format (Parquet, Avro) used is supported by the target storage.
* Access Permissions: Ensure proper access control is in place for Azure Data Lake Storage (RBAC, ACLs).
* Storage Quotas: Monitor storage capacity to ensure the Data Lake has enough space to store incoming data.
### 4. Data Analytics and Query Troubleshooting Points
### Slow Query Performance
* Queries run slowly in Azure Synapse Analytics
* Query Optimization: Review and optimize Synapse SQL queries, especially for large datasets (avoid using SELECT *).
* Partitioning: Ensure that Delta tables are properly partitioned for faster query performance.
* Materialized Views: Use materialized views in Synapse to speed up frequent queries.
### Query Failure
* Queries fail or return errors.
* Check SQL Errors: Look for SQL-specific errors in Synapse logs (e.g., syntax errors, missing tables).
* Check Data Format: Verify that the data is in a readable format for querying (e.g., Parquet, Delta).
* Resource Limits: Ensure sufficient resources are allocated to Synapse for complex queries.
### Data Consistency Issues
* Discrepancies between the data in the warehouse and the original source.
* Data Pipeline Auditing: Implement and monitor auditing logic to check if the data in Synapse matches the source after transformations.
* Time-Travel in Delta: Use Delta Lake’s time-travel feature to query previous versions of data.
### Security Troubleshooting Points
### Access Denied Issues
* Errors due to lack of access permissions (e.g., in Data Lake or Synapse).
* Review RBAC Permissions: Ensure the right roles are assigned to users or service principals (e.g., Reader, Contributor).
* Access Logs: Check access logs in Azure Monitor for unauthorized access attempts.
* Service Principal Authentication: Ensure that the service principal is configured with the correct permissions for accessing resources like Key Vault, Data Lake, and Synapse.
### Data Encryption Issues
* Inability to decrypt data or access encrypted files.
* Key Vault Configuration: Ensure that the encryption keys in Key Vault are accessible and valid.
* Encryption Settings: Ensure encryption is correctly applied during data storage and transformation.
* Data Masking: Verify if any data masking is required for sensitive information.
### 6. Monitoring and Logging Troubleshooting Points
### Missing Alerts
* No alerts when a failure occurs in ADF, Databricks, or Synapse.
* Alert Configuration: Ensure Azure Monitor alerts are properly configured for failures, job timeouts, and performance issues.
* Alert Thresholds: Check if alert thresholds are too high or not set correctly for the issues you want to track.
### Logging Gaps
* Missing logs for specific activities or processes.
* Enable Detailed Logging: Increase logging verbosity in ADF, Databricks, and Synapse.
* Log Forwarding: Ensure logs are being forwarded to Log Analytics or another centralized logging solution for monitoring.
* Monitor Log Retention: Check log retention settings to ensure logs are available when needed for troubleshooting.
### 7. General Troubleshooting Best Practices
* Use ADF Monitoring: Use the built-in ADF monitoring tools to track pipeline runs, investigate failures, and re-run pipelines.
* Implement Retry Logic: Set retry logic in pipelines to recover from transient issues like network failures or timeouts.
* Set Up Alerts: Use Azure Monitor to configure alerts for pipeline failures, performance issues, and data quality problems.
* Use Version Control: Use Git integration for pipeline version control, ensuring that changes can be tracked and reverted if necessary.
